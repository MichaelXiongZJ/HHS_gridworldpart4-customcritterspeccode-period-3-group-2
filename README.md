SocialAnxietyCritter (SAC): A SocialAnxietyCritter can enter the grid as either a Rock or a Critter. If it has Critter neighbors, it changes its appearance to a rock, and acts like a rock, which means it sits around and does nothing. Once there are no neighboring Critters, it returns into a Critter. The SocialAnxietyCritter doesnâ€™t eat anything. The SocialAnxietyCritter moves away from the closest Critter (if there are two Critters at the same distance away, the SAC chooses one at random), in the opposite direction (whichever one of the 8 cardinal directions is closest to this direction. If the SAC cannot move in this direction, it just stays still. If there are no other Critters in the Grid, it moves like a Critter

Code Hint: You are going to need more than one class (SocialAnxietyCritter & SocialAnxietyRock)

Runners:
One where it turns into a rock A
One where it turns back into a Critter B
One where it stays as a rock C
One where it stays as a critter due to no neighbors D
One where it moves away E
